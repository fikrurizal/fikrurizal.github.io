I am a research fellow at the Health Economics Group within the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University. My research interests lie in the intersection between health economics and development economics, particularly socioeconomic inequality in health and healthcare access and financing.

I am a medical doctor by training from Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia). I hold an MSc in Health Economics from Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and a PhD in Health Economics from the Centre for Health Economics (CHE), Monash Business School, Australia. My PhD thesis is on the economic determinants of health and healthcare utilisation in Indonesia. 

Apart from academic research, I have vast experience working with with key policymakers (mainly in Indonesia) as a consultant.
